# something-blogger-template

## [Preview](http://somethingbloggertheme.blogspot.sg/)
'Something' is a minimalistic responsive blogger template. To keep it simple, there are only three widgets at the bottom of the page, namely 'About', 'Blog Archive' and 'Advertisement'. Feel free to edit or add more widgets in the blogger layout page. It comes with a playful header that turns 180 degree when you touch it. You may change the header background in the header widget located in the blogger layout page.

My first try on blogger template. It's 'something'. :')
